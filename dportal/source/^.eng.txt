What is it?

#^index_paragraph1_text
helps you explore IATI data by providing a search function and information by country or by publisher on development activities and budgets published to the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI). It is aimed at providing line ministries, parliamentarians and civil society in developing countries with information that can assist with the planning and monitoring of development activities.

#^index_paragraph2_text
d-portal contains current data published through the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) as well as the most recent year's data available in the OECD DAC Creditor Reporting System.

#^index_title2_text
Where is the data from?

#^index_paragraph3_text
Data in the dropdown menu is built from the <a href="https://github.com/devinit/D-Portal/tree/master/dstore">database</a> which updates everyday at GMT +0 with new data fetched from the IATI Registry.

#^index_paragraph4_text
We list countries that are reported by publishers using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2">ISO3166 Alpha-2</a>. For attribution and links to data sources, <a href="about.html#sources">go here</a>.

#^index_paragraph5_text
The list of publishers with their IATI publisher ID comes straight from the IATI Registry database.

#^index_paragraph6_text
The dropdown list of publishers comes from published XML activities reported by these publishers.

#^feedback_paragraph1_text
Hello all and thank you for taking part as beta testers for d-portal.org. We welcome any and all feedback, suggestions and concerns you may have about the website so please feel free to post them as comments below. Overall, we want to focus on legibility and user experience, especially in terms of understanding the data that is being presented.

#^feedback_paragraph2_text
Thank you very much for taking the time to do this! We hope to create something useful and easily deployable, an interesting talking point but most importantly, promote use by those who need the information, and better data quality from reporting organisations.

About d-portal.org

#^about_paragraph_title_text
What is it?

#^about_paragraph1_text
d-portal.org helps you explore IATI data by providing a search function and information by country or by publisher on development activities and budgets published to the platform.

#^about_paragraph2_text
It is aimed at providing line ministries, parliamentarians and civil society in developing countries with information that can assist with the planning and monitoring of development activities.

#^about_paragraph3_text
d-portal contains current data published to the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) as well as the most recent year's data available in the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/crsguide.htm" target="_blank" class="co">OECD DAC Creditor Reporting System</a>. 

#^about_paragraph4_text
The current platform poses two questions:

#^about_paragraph5_text
In order to answer these questions from a country perspective it is insufficient merely to display available data: it is equally important to show the gaps in the information. Coping with poor quality or missing data is an essential part of the information interface. 

#^about_paragraph6_text
is an open source platform. This means you can use all aspects of the platform to build your own portal using the free source code.

#^about_paragraph7_text
While it currently provides a generic deployment for any country it has been developed with the specific intention of being customised in-country to meet local needs. For further information on how you could create a customised version for a specific country, see <a href="#install" class="how">How to Install</a>.

#^about_paragraph8_text
Funding

#^about_paragraph9_text
The initial development of d-portal.org which ran from Dec 2013 to the Global Partnership meeting in Mexico in April 2014 was funded by <a href="http://www.aidtransparency.net/" target="_blank" class="co">IATI</a> and <a href="http://devinit.org/" target="_blank" class="co">Development Initiatives (DI)</a>.

#^about_paragraph10_text
IATI is funding current development. If you are interested in funding part of the ongoing development of d-portal, or specific pieces of future development, please contact <a href="mailto:support@iatistandard.org" target="_blank" class="co">support@iatistandard.org</a>

#^about_paragraph11_text
The open source concept relies on sharing resources in the hopes that others will join in and build a better platform together. This includes finding and reporting bugs, contributing new features that you'd like the platform to have or even creating new themes so that others may use it.

#^about_paragraph12_text

Installing d-portal

#^install_paragraph1_text
At the heart of the d-portal project is the aim that anyone anywhere could take the open source code behind d-portal, deploy it for themselves and create a customised d-portal for any country that interests them.  This could include adding any other data from Aid Information Management Systems, national budgets and a range of comparable socio-economic indicators.

#^install_paragraph2_text
There are already examples of customised country-specific d-portals like 

#^install_paragraph3_text
d-portal is made up of the dstore backend and ctrack interface. To install d-portal, you need to set up a server.

Dash - Publisher statistics

#^dash_paragraph1_text
Dash is an overview of the data populating d-portal.org with a focus primarily on publisher statistics and the quality of the data reported by them.

#^dash_paragraph2_text
By showing you when and where invalid data is reported, Dash will be able to explain the gaps that are reflected on the main site.

#^dash_paragraph3_text
Dash is not country specific so you will be able to view all of the publisher statistics available across all countries included in the portal. This is to accommodate the fact that there are multiple publishers that report activities in multiple recipient countries.

#^dash_paragraph4_text
Dash is constantly being updated <a href="http://d-portal.org/ctrack.html?#view=dash">http://d-portal.org/ctrack.html?#view=dash</a>

#^gen_title_text
Generator widgets for your website

#^gen_paragraph1_text
There is a huge amount of interesting information within IATI and significant value in being able to share bite-size pieces of it freely on other websites and blogs. The d-portal generator allows users to select specific information from d-portal and embed it directly into their own website code.

#^gen_paragraph2_text
Once you’ve embedded any content it will update automatically (overnight) as publishers’ data is updated in the IATI registry. When users click on the content they will be directed to the relevant page on d-portal so they can investigate further.

#^gen_paragraph3_text

#^faq_general_q1_text
What is d-portal?

#^faq_general_a1_text
A view of all IATI (<a href="http://www.aidtransparency.net">International Aid Transparency Initiative</a>) data by recipient country or publisher, comparable with latest OECD DAC CRS (<a href="https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=CRS1">Creditor Reporting System</a>) data.

#^faq_general_q2_text
Which datasets are included in d-portal?

#^faq_general_a2_text
<a href="http://www.aidtransparency.net">IATI</a> and <a href="https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=CRS1">CRS</a> data (see below for more information).

#^faq_general_q3_text
What is IATI?

#^faq_general_a3_text
The <a href="http://www.aidtransparency.net">International Aid Transparency Initiative</a> - IATI is a voluntary, multi-stakeholder initiative that seeks to improve the transparency of aid, development, and humanitarian resources in order to increase their effectiveness in tackling poverty. 

#^faq_general_q4_text
What is OECD DAC CRS?

#^faq_general_a4_text
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Development Assistance Committee <a href="https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=CRS1">Creditor Reporting System</a> - which contains Official Development Assistance data.

#^faq_general_q5_text
Where does the data come from?

#^faq_general_a5_text
The IATI data comes from the <a href="http://www.iatiregistry.org/">IATI Registry</a>. 
<p>The CRS data comes from <a href="https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=CRS1">CRS tables</a> and stored on <a href="https://github.com/devinit/D-Portal/tree/master/dstore/csv">Github</a>.</p>

#^faq_general_q6_text
Why is there data missing in some parts of d-portal?

#^faq_general_a6_text
Publishers report their IATI data at varying degrees of detail, and data is updated and improved all the time by publishers.  If a publisher only publishes data for 2013, it won’t appear in 2014 columns/charts etc.  
<p>d-portal attempts to only reflect what is in the data and does not make corrections to data or information published to IATI, with only small exceptions to make the site user-friendly*</p>
<p>See also information about <a href="http://d-portal.org/ctrack.html?country=AF&tongue=eng#view=data_quality">data quality</a> (<i>Afghanistan used as example</i>)</p>

#^faq_general_q7_text
Why are there zeroes and dashes in the tables?

#^faq_general_a7_text
Zeroes may denote issues with data quality (eg codes, dates, etc which are incompatible with the IATI Standard).  <i>There will shortly be links to the publisher’s page on the <a href="http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/index.html">IATI dashboard</a> to investigate specific data quality issues.</i>
<p>Dashes show that that donor/organisation is not currently an IATI publisher.</p>

#^faq_general_q8_text
When / how is data in d-portal updated?

#^faq_general_a8_text
Newly published files are updated every night, as well as a full re-import of all files. The re-import ensures that any external value that may have been changed; for example, exchange rates, will be applied to all relevant data. Data is pulled from the IATI Registry.
<p>CRS data is downloaded annually when it becomes available and then stored in <a href="https://github.com/devinit/D-Portal/tree/master/dstore/csv">Github</a>.</p>

#^faq_general_q9_text
Where can I see more detail on IATI data quality issues/stats on how often organisations are publishing, etc?

#^faq_general_a9_text

#^faq_general_q13_text
What are common reasons for a publisher’s data not showing in parts of d-portal?

#^faq_general_a13_text
Data that is marked as invalid IATI xml when using the <a href="http://validator.iatistandard.org/">Validator</a>.
<p>Mismatch between ‘Identifier’ in publisher’s profile in the <a href="https://iatiregistry.org/">IATI Registry</a>, and <a href="http://iatistandard.org/203/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/reporting-org/">reporting-org</a> in that publisher’s data – this will show zeroes in the publisher’s data until the two are matched.</p>
<p><a href="http://iatistandard.org/203/codelists/TransactionType/">Transaction type code</a> not present.</p>
<p>Not using either Disbursements or Expenditure in <a href="http://iatistandard.org/203/codelists/TransactionType/">transaction type</a> field.</p>
<p>Country and Sector graphs are displayed by adding up <a href="http://iatistandard.org/203/codelists/TransactionType/">Transaction type codes</a> 3 (Disbursement) and 4 (Expenditure) so activities without transactions or the right transaction type codes will not have these graphs.</p>
<p><a href="http://iatistandard.org/203/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/activity-date/">Dates</a> in incorrect format in the data.</p>
<p>Activities without end date are not shown on the list of projects ending soon or any lists that need an end date to order them.</p>
<p>The map section will not be shown if there are no activities with longitude and latitude data.</p>
<p>Illogical dates such as activity end date before activity start date.</p>
<p>No data relevant to the year being viewed on a pie chart or table (eg where a pie chart shows 2016 data and data published only relates to 2015).</p>
<p>If updating your Registry profile only, changes will show after the weekly full import (each weekend) as d-portal only updates nightly the data that has been changed in the xml.</p>

#^faq_technical_q1_text
Which transaction types are used/not used in d-portal?

#^faq_technical_a1_text
‘Expenditure’ and ‘Disbursements’ for Spend columns/data. If there are neither, but ‘Outgoing Commitment’ data exists, then the Outgoing Commitment data will be shown.
<p>'Outgoing commitment' for Total commitment columns. If outgoing commitments have not been published, but Disbursement and Expenditure exist, then the sum of Disbursement and Expenditure will be shown.</p>
<p>‘Budgets’ in activity file, for Budget columns/data (eg in tables on d-portal) - if no budget data is present in the activity file, then ‘planned-disbursements’ are used if present.</p>

#^faq_technical_q2_text
How / where is the data tidied up before being displayed in d-portal?

#^faq_technical_a2_text
<ul>
	<li>If a transaction date is not present, d-portal uses the transaction-value date in order to ascertain the date of a transaction (and therefore assign it to a specific year).</li>
	<li>Only displaying countries that exist in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2">ISO3166 Alpha-2</a>.</li>
	<li>Removing secondary publishers - flagged as secondary sources in IATI Registry - from tables (to avoid double counting, eg secondary publishers are for example UN-OCHA who re-publish data which would replicate data from those publishers in the same table - see here for <a href="https://github.com/devinit/D-Portal/issues/156">list of secondary publishers</a> excluded in these instances).</li>
	<li>Not displaying publishers with 0 datasets in the IATI Registry.</li>
	<li>If there are neither Expenditure nor Disbursement data but Commitment data does exist then the Commitment data will be displayed.</li>
	<li>In order to match against CRS data in tables, government departments are combined and shown under the country name - details of which departments are in <a href="https://github.com/devinit/D-Portal/tree/master/dstore/csv">Github</a>.</li>
	<li><i>There are currently plans under consideration to use the lowest hierarchy level data only, should data at multiple hierarchies exist, in order to avoid double counting.</i></li>
</ul>

#^faq_technical_q3_text
How is data apportioned to a specific year?

#^faq_technical_a3_text
Using the transaction value date/transaction date (eg in Spend columns in tables).
<p>Using the end date in the budget data (eg in Budget columns in tables).</p>

#^faq_technical_q4_text
What counts as a ‘missing project’?

#^faq_technical_a4_text
Anything with invalid date ranges (eg start date after the end date).
<p>Projects with invalid date ranges that cannot be placed in one of the other 3 categories (Active, Planned, Ended).</p>

#^faq_technical_q5_text
How are exchange rates calculated?

#^faq_technical_a5_text
<ul>
	<li>Default USD
	<p>Currently (please note this may change soon) converting to USD using the exchange rate of the date specified in the <b>value-date</b> attribute. So when we display USD, it is very accurate to that date.</p></li>

	<li>Other currencies
	<p>For other currencies, the USD value is just converted using today’s exchange rate (please note this may change soon).</p></li>

	<li>For budget information in future?
	<p>Using the latest exchange rates (<a href="http://www.imf.org/external/np/fin/data/rms_five.aspx">International Monetary Fund</a>) every night and doing a full re-import once a week, so future budgets will use the current exchange rates and should be updated weekly.</p></li>
</ul>

#^faq_technical_q6_text
What are the criteria for my organisation’s data appearing in recipient country charts/tables/maps in d-portal?

#^faq_technical_a6_text
For charts - need a transaction with transaction date in the relevant year (the latest complete year, eg currently 2014) with a valid recipient country code or valid sector code, depending on which chart it is.
<p>For tables - as above, with transaction date relating to the relevant year column in the table.</p>
<p>For maps - any transactions (from any year) with valid location tag and recipient country code
(to be valid it needs to be on the relevant IATI codelists).</p>

#^faq_technical_q7_text
Where do country codes/descriptions come from?

#^faq_technical_a7_text
This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2">Wikipedia page</a> with ISO codes.

#^faq_technical_q8_text
What classifies something as an active, ended or planned project?

#^faq_technical_a8_text
Activity start/end dates are used to work out which projects are active or ended or planned for the future.  
<ul>
	<li>Active projects are projects with a start date in the past and with an end date in the future.</li>
	<li>Ended projects are projects with an end date in the past.</li>
	<li>Planned projects are anything with a start date in the future.</li>
</ul>

#^faq_technical_q9_text
How is the map data produced?

#^faq_technical_a9_text
Using ‘location’ tags within the data to plot projects on the maps - either lat/long or point/pos, depending on which the publisher uses.

#^faq_technical_q10_text
How are US government organisations shown?

#^faq_technical_a10_text
All collated under heading ‘United States’.

#^faq_technical_q11_text
Where does the data for Single Activity Viewer (SAVi) come from?

#^faq_technical_a11_text
These pages for individual activities come from <a href="http://www.iatiregistry.org/">IATI Registry</a>.

#^faq_technical_q12_text
Where can I find the code/README/project management information for d-portal?

#^faq_technical_a12_text
<a href="https://github.com/devinit/D-Portal">https://github.com/devinit/D-Portal</a>

#^faq_technical_q13_text
Where is the additional data for d-portal stored?

#^faq_technical_a13_text
Additional data is stored in <a href="https://github.com/devinit/D-Portal/tree/master/dstore/csv">Github</a>, including
<ul>
	<li>list of funder Org IDs</li>
	<li>currencies</li>
	<li>exchange rates</li>
	<li>sector codes</li>
	<li>CRS data</li>
</ul>

#^faq_technical_q14_text
When is ctrack updated?

#^faq_technical_a14_text
Newly published files are updated every night, as well as a full re-import of all files. The re-import ensures that any external value that may have been changed; for example, exchange rates, will be applied to all relevant data.

#^faq_technical_q15_text
What counts as 2014 (chart) data?

#^faq_technical_a15_text
An activity which includes part of 2014 according to the activity’s start and end dates.

#^faq_technical_q16_text
Why are sector aggregations using three-digit codes when five-digit codes are published?

#^faq_technical_a16_text
Some publishers only produce data with 3 digit codes. We convert the 5 digit codes to 3 digits to unify the data for visualisation on d-portal.

#^faq_technical_q17_text
For the country and sector graphs on the acitivity pages, why have your changed them into bars?

#^faq_technical_a17_text
Google charts have deprecated these graphs - some country graphs are showing up as empty even when there is data in them. Bar charts allow users to see the data in relation to each other.

#^faq_technical_q18_text
Why are some graphs missing for some types of transactions on the acitivity pages?

#^faq_technical_a18_text
We're only showing graphs that have been published using the same currency. We've kept SAVi (Simple Activity Viewer) as simple as possible so there are no extra calculations made on the page, just displaying the raw xml as we get them.

#^faq_technical_q19_text
Why are there less nodules on some of the graphs for transactions on the activity pages?

#^faq_technical_a19_text
The transactions are merged if they are published for the same date.
<p>The last transaction will stretch across the lifetime of the activity.</p>

#^faq_technical_q20_text
Why are some data not showing up on the activity pages when they are available in the XML?

#^faq_technical_a20_text
We display machine-readable data where possible (ie. when we have codelists for those elements), narratives within these elements will not be displayed.

#^faq_explore_q1_text
What is EXPLORE?

#^faq_explore_a1_text
EXPLORE is made up of two parts – a series of filters, and a freetext box.
<p><b>1. Filters</b></p>
<p>These are a selection of filters relating to the <a href="http://iatistandard.org/">IATI Standard</a> allowing users to choose and refine the IATI data they want to explore.</p>
<p><b>2. Freetext</b></p>
<p>This is a freetext box allowing users to search for themes and topics, and specific activities published to IATI.</p>


#^faq_explore_q2_text
What does EXPLORE do?

#^faq_explore_a2_text
The EXPLORE feature is on the front page of <a href="http://d-portal.org">d-portal.org</a> and helps users find activities published to the IATI Standard based on keywords - it was originally developed to help people who wanted to find information on specific humanitarian crises.

#^faq_explore_q3_text
How can I use the filters?

#^faq_explore_a3_text
Select multiple filters from across the dropdowns.  As you build a query using these filters the space underneath the filters will populate with an indication of how many activities are available to view based on your selections.
<p>You can then click ‘<b>Explore Results</b>’ to find out more about those activities.</p>

#^faq_explore_q4_text
What is the data in the dropdown lists within filters?

#^faq_explore_a4_text
<b>Recipient Country</b> and <b>Publisher</b>
<p>The organisations that have published to the <a href="http://iatistandard.org/">IATI Standard</a>, and the countries where funds have gone to as published within IATI data.</p>
<p><b>Sector Group</b> and <b>Sector</b></p>
<p>The numeric codes and names to describe sectors within the <a href="https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=CRS1">OECD DAC CRS</a>, as used within the IATI Standard.</p>
<p><b>Activity Status</b></p>
<p>The numeric codes and names within the <a href="http://iatistandard.org/203/codelists/ActivityStatus/">IATI activity status</a> field.</p>
<p><b>Year Range</b></p>
<p>Years from 1960 to ‘present year + 2’.</p>
<p><b>More filters</b></p>
<p>The numeric codes and names within the <a href="http://iatistandard.org/203/codelists/ActivityStatus/">IATI activity status</a> field. Click on <b>Glossary</b> to find out more about individual filters.</p>

#^faq_explore_q5_text
How can I use and refine the freetext search?

#^faq_explore_a5_text
Type in one or more keywords and press enter to see how many activities have been found.
<p>Click ‘<b>Explore Results</b>’ to see lists, graphs and maps allowing further exploration of the data.</p>
<p>Refine your search by adding multiple words – e.g. ‘<i>Hurricane Matthew</i>’ will find more refined (fewer) results than ‘<i>Hurricane</i>’.</p>

#^faq_explore_q6_text
How / what do the EXPLORE search results show?

#^faq_explore_a6_text
Clicking ‘<b>Explore Results</b>’ provides results in the usual d-portal format (stats and charts which you can explore by clicking through to tables).

#^faq_explore_q7_text
When doing a freetext search, what IATI fields are being searched?

#^faq_explore_a7_text
This searches the <a href="http://iatistandard.org/203/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/title/">Title</a> and <a href="http://iatistandard.org/203/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/description/">Description</a> fields within all published IATI activities.

#^faq_explore_q8_text
Do plural nouns work in freetext search?

#^faq_explore_a8_text
EXPLORE is adapted for English plural nouns - e.g. typing ‘<i>Refugee</i>’ will include results for ‘<i>Refugees</i>’.

#^faq_explore_q9_text
How does the Trending buttons work?

#^faq_explore_a9_text
The <b>COVID-19</b> button follows the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11XTnrPw8K76JvBhFfnqo-1Z9BmgqzWv2bEz9QoDrw2k">IATI Publishing Guidance</a>. It currently searches the database for COVID-19 in title and description fields and looks for the relevant codes in the <b>humanitarian-scope</b> element.

#^faq_generator_q1_text
What is it?

#^faq_generator_a1_text
The <a href="http://d-portal.org/ctrack.html#view=generator">Generator</a> is a tool to help users to reproduce data from d-portal in other webpages/blogs.

#^faq_generator_q2_text
Why does it exist?

#^faq_generator_a2_text
To help users who want to display their own data, or data they are interested in, within their own website/blog.

#^faq_generator_q3_text
How do I use it?

#^faq_generator_a3_text
Make selections from the dropdown menus and C&amp;P the code provided into your webpage’s html.
<p>For more information see <a href="http://www.d-portal.org/news/2014-11-30-Interactive-IATI-data-d-portal-generator.html">http://www.d-portal.org/news/2014-11-30-Interactive-IATI-data-d-portal-generator.html</a></p>

#^faq_generator_q4_text
How often will the generated content on my webpage update?

#^faq_generator_a4_text
It’s dynamic, so will update automatically overnight. If you change your data, this will be reflected. So when you’ve got content from the generator in your site or blog post, it will change accordingly!

#^faq_generator_q5_text
How reliable is it?

#^faq_generator_a5_text
The embedded data in your blog post / website will stay up as long as the d-portal site is up (eg permanently).
<p>The only time this can go wrong is if your website provider disallows you to include external widgets in your blog posts, ie. if you can embed a youtube video into your blog post, you can embed generator content in your post.</p>

#^faq_generator_q6_text
Help! I'm trying to create the widget in my company's internal website but it's not working.

#^faq_generator_a6_text
Both secured and non-secured HTTP access is enabled and supported on d-portal. This should let users on secured domains use Generator content.
<p>Use <a href="https://d-portal.org/ctrack.html#view=generator">https://d-portal.org/ctrack.html#view=generator</a> instead.</p>
<p>If you are unsure if this affects you, see if your company's website uses http<b>s</b>:// instead of http:// in the website address.</p>
